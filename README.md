All smart contract platforms have to deal with two problems: correct execution, and resource consumption. These are particularly hard to solve on a decentralized platform.

Zen takes F* as the starting point for defining smart contracts. F*, developed by Microsoft Research, is a functional language aimed at formal verification. Zen uses F*'s powerful proof techniques both to create proofs of correctness, and to prove that contracts execute in a limited amount of time. Proofs of correctness mean that anyone can write a new contract, implementing a particular kind of asset—a call option for example—and any user or contract can immediately discover and use that asset, with confidence that it performs as it claims to.
